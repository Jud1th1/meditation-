## Overview

The Serenity Now App is a meditation and relaxation application that provides users with a selection of ambient sounds and calming visuals for a serene and immersive experience. The app is designed to offer a simple and intuitive interface, allowing users to choose from a curated playlist of 10-minute meditation sessions, each accompanied by a soothing background video and calming background music.

### The challenge

The primary challenge of this project was to create a mobile-friendly application that delivers a seamless user experience. Integrating both video and audio elements posed unique challenges in terms of performance optimization, ensuring fast loading times, and maintaining a visually appealing design across various devices.

## My process

1. **Conceptualization**: I defined the concept and core features of the Serenity Now App, based on a few clock tutorials I followed online. I wanted to take what I learned and amplify it by creating a meditation app focusing on simplicity, ease of use, and an immersive meditation experience.

2. **Design and Styling**: I created a clean and visually pleasing design, incorporating a responsive layout to ensure an optimal experience on mobile devices. This project served as an opportunity to use a pure css image I made for the intro screen.

3. **Frontend Development**: Implemented the frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Integrated the Swiper library for the playlist carousel and designed custom controls for video and audio playback.

4. **Audio Integration**: Utilized the HTML5 `<audio>` element to seamlessly integrate background music with play, pause, and reset controls.

5. **Testing**: Conducted extensive testing across various devices and browsers to ensure compatibility and performance. Made adjustments to enhance the user experience.
